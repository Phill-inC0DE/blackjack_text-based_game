# Blackjack Text Game
[Final Project tasked by Codecademy: First independant project]

Progress: Ongoing

## First Task | Build a Deck of 52 cards, 4 suits, and individual values.
Maybe this is set up as an array, with four arrays (one for each suit). Don't want to explicitly write out a 52 length array, so set up a method that does this for you. Alternatively, maybe use hash key/values? key is suit and value is card type? Arrays are ordered though.

## Second Task | Randomize through the Deck and select two cards.
Shuffle the cards - randomize deck somehow. Can you just randomize an entire array? Look that up - go back to book shuffle exercise for reference. Probably separate init/shuffle methods. That way, only need to create deck once, can re-shuffle for a new game.
