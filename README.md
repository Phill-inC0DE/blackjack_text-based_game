# Blackjack Text-based Game
[Final Project tasked by Codecademy: First independant project]

Progress: COMPLETED

As you can see their is a first attempt file and a singular python file called blackjack.py.
The blackjack.py is my perfect game after trial and error, I included my original code as to show you where I went wrong and corrected my mistakes. If I had never worked on that first attempt I don't this final result would of been anywhere near as good, it helped me practice and hone my skill, so I felt it only right to include it.

Apologies for having the script in one file, I tried splitting them up after completeing the project into classes, functions etc... but it turned out to be more complicated than I thought and I'd spent enough time on this project as it was so I thought I practice that next time. If you have any tips or additional things you would of like to see in the game please contact me, I'll happily make the adjustments.


# Project Steps:
## First Task | Build a Deck of 52 cards, 4 suits, and individual values.
I started by building classes that would allow me to build each card with a value and then shuffle those cards round the deck and place them into the player and dealers hand.

## Second Task | Building the chips to place bets.
I also made a class for the chips that held the value of how many chips they started with, how much they would win if the player won. Then included some additional features for fun such as allowing the player to go into debt by taking out a loan and tracking that debt amount whilst paying it off each time they won.

## Third Task | The start up Greeting and placing bets.
I needed a function that would check the time of the day and reply back with either morning, afternoon or evening. While asking for the player name and using it throughtout so the experience is more personalised. The player would then be offered chips up front and how many of the chips they would like to bet. Additionally I added the extra feature, where if the player where to run out of chips they would then be prompet a loan request.

## Fourth Task | Asking the loan amount and keeping track of the debt, whilst paying off the debt.
I thought of this feature towards the end of writing my code as an extra challenge for myself but also it would be a way for the player to carry on with their game. (sort of like an extra life) It turned out be a lot more challenging than I first thought, but I had a lot of fun with and got the result I was after.

## Fifth Task | Functions for working out who won and who lost or if it was a tie.
Pretty self explanitory, I had to basically work out all angles the player & dealer could lose and place them into several functions.

## Six Task | Iterating all the classes and functions into one While loop, to allow a restart of the game.
This final step brings everything together and allows the whole game to be restarted when prompted, a lot of adjustments had to be made for this step to work correctly. I then also customized the prompts to fit well with the overall feel ofthe game.

## Final Task | Debugging
Constant back and forth running the code and adjusting it to every different scenerio the game went was actually quite challenging. But I'm happy with my overall result, I can hopefully say that I found every possible bug I challenge you to find one! if so please message me I will happily make the adjustments.
